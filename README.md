### Notes
Most of the challanges I encountered during this assignment were related to displaying the app. It would build fine but the app would instantly shut down the first reason for this was because I needed androidx and the second reason is due to a spelling mistake.

### Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Androids
